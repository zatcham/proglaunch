# proglaunch

This Java program launches every program in a defined directory, with a set launch interval between each program. 
I originally made this to mess around with Java and GUIs within it, and later ended up using it to bulk install programs onto a computer and perform malware analysis in virtual machines. 

It still has a few bugs, which I might fix one day. Wouldn't recommend using it for anything important ðŸ˜„
